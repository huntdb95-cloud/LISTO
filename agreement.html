<h3 class="legal-title">SUBCONTRACTORS AGREEMENT</h3>
<p>
                This Document is a binding contract, which will serve as a blanket agreement for and between Kristina
                Chapman Contractor Dba Chapman &amp; Chapman Homes herein known as Builder, and the undersigned referred
                to hereafter as Subcontractor. By signing, Subcontractor and Builder agree to the terms set forth herein.
                This agreement shall remain in force from the date hereof and from year to year, unless a change is
                agreed to in writing by both Builder and Subcontractor. The parties agree to the following:
              </p>
<h4>1. GENERAL PERFORMANCE</h4>
<p>
                All Work of the Subcontractor will be performed in a good and workmanlike manner in accordance with the plans
                and specifications for each job and must comply with all Federal and State laws, codes and regulations and all
                county and/or municipal ordinances and regulations effective where the work is to be performed under this contract.
                All permits, fees, taxes, and expenses connected with such compliance are to be paid by the Subcontractor.
              </p>
<h4>2. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR</h4>
<p>
                The Builder and Subcontractor agree that the Subcontractor is being hired solely as an Independent Contractor
                and that neither the Subcontractor, nor his employees shall be deemed to be employees of the Builder.
              </p>
<h4>3. TIME</h4>
<p>
                The Subcontractor agrees to promptly begin work as soon as notified by the Builder, and to complete the work
                in a professional and workmanlike manner within a reasonable period of time once work is commenced and in any
                event by the deadlines established by the Builder in writing. Subcontractor shall cooperate with other trades
                who are also on the jobsite so that each reasonably may complete their respective work within the required time
                frames and Subcontractor shall in any event complete Subcontractor’s work within a time that will allow any other
                trade whose work depends on the completion of Subcontractor’s work to also timely complete its work. At all times,
                Subcontractor shall provide competent supervision, a sufficient number of skilled workers and adequate and proper
                materials to maintain Builder’s work schedule. Subcontractor warrants to Builder that he has all proper and necessary
                licenses and permits to perform the services contracted for by Builder. If Builder determines that Subcontractor’s work
                does not conform to the provisions of the Drawings and Specifications, or that the work is not of appropriate quality,
                Builder shall advise Subcontractor, and if Subcontractor does not correct such defects or errors on Builder’s time table,
                builder shall have the right to correct the defects and to charge back the Subcontractor the cost of such corrections.
              </p>
<h4>4. EXTRAS</h4>
<p>No deviations from the work specified in the contract will be permitted or paid for unless a written extra work or change order is first agreed upon and signed as required.</p>
<h4>5. ASSIGNMENT</h4>
<p>No assignment of this subcontract agreement by Subcontractor is permitted without prior written permission from the Builder.</p>
<h4>6. HOLD HARMLESS</h4>
<p>
                The Subcontractor agrees to protect, defend and indemnify the Builder against and hold the Builder harmless for any and all claims,
                demands, liabilities, losses, expenses, suits and actions (including attorney’s fees) for or on account of any injury to any person,
                or any death at any time resulting from such injury, or any damage to any property, which may arise (or which may be alleged to have risen)
                out of or in connection with the work covered by this subcontract even though such injury, death, or damage may be (or may be alleged to be)
                attributable in part to negligence or other fault on the part of the Builder or his officers, agents or employees. If Builder reasonably believes
                that Subcontractor will or has caused a claim to be made or a lien to be filed against Builder’s Property, Builder may retain any and all monies due
                Subcontractor and make such payment to Subcontractor and claimant jointly. The obligation of the Subcontractor to indemnify and hold the Builder harmless
                shall not be enforceable if and only if it be determined by arbitration of judicial proceeding that the injury, death or damages complained or was attributable
                solely to the fault or negligence of the Builder or his officers, agents, or employees and not in any manner or in any part attributable to the Subcontractor.
                The Subcontractor agrees to reimburse the Builder for all sums, which the Builder may pay or be compelled to pay in settlement of any claim hereunder, including
                any claim under the provisions of any workmen’s compensation law or any plan for employees’ benefits which the Builder may adopt. The Builder shall be entitled
                to withhold from payment otherwise due pursuant to this subcontract such amount or amounts as may be reasonably necessary to protect it against liability for any
                personal injury, death or property damage resulting from the performance of the work hereunder.
              </p>
<h4>7. MECHANICS LIEN</h4>
<p>
                Subcontractor shall furnish all partial and final lien waivers and release and sworn statements under the Tennessee State Mechanic’s Lien Law, for Subcontractor and
                for all Subcontractor’s material men and suppliers in a form satisfactory and acceptable to Builder as a condition precedent to partial and final payments to Subcontractor
                hereunder, as may be required by Builder.
              </p>
<p>
                If any lien or other encumbrance or any claim of the nonpayment of labor, materials or supplies furnished to Subcontractor is asserted, claimed or filed against Builder’s
                property arising out of the contract or said work hereunder, notwithstanding the furnishing of said lien waivers or sworn statements by Subcontractor on the making of any said
                payments to Subcontractor, the Subcontractor shall protect, indemnify, hold harmless and defend the Builder, and its successors an assigns, from and against all such liens and
                encumbrances and all costs, fee, loss, damage and expenses (including, but not limit to attorneys fees and litigation expenses) in connection therewith. Any such assertion or claim
                may be treated by Builder as default of the contract and Builder on behalf of itself may take action as it deems necessary to mitigate its damages and charge the cost and expense
                thereof to Subcontractor.
              </p>
<h4>8. CLEAN-UP</h4>
<p>
                Subcontractor agrees to clean up all debris, trash, and refuse generated by his own trade at the end of each day and deposit into trash bin provided by Builder, and shall clean
                all walls, floors and other finished surfaces soiled as a result of his trade. Subcontractor further agrees to deposit into trash bin or haul away all boxes, crates, or containers
                that may have been used to bring materials or fixtures to the job site. Subcontractor agrees to leave the job broom clean for the next trade. In the event the Subcontractor fails to
                comply with the above after receiving the proper notice of the problem and the opportunity to correct it, Builder may back charge the Subcontractor for the cost of the debris removal and clean up.
                The subcontractor should report the Builder if the job has not been cleaned within acceptable practices by the prior Subcontractor.
              </p>
<h4>9. DEFAULT</h4>
<p>
                If Subcontractor shall default in the performance of any of his duties or obligations hereunder, and such default shall continue after verbal or written notice, Builder may immediately terminate this Agreement.
                Subcontractor shall be due only such sums for approved work up until termination and shall furnish lien waivers to Builder upon termination and payment.
              </p>
<h4>10. CARE OF MATERIALS</h4>
<p>
                Subcontractor agrees to be diligent in the proper care of materials supplied by Builder. All usable materials are to be stored in an orderly way that protects them from wind, moisture, and provides general site safety.
                All non-usable materials are to be culled and properly disposed of in trash bins provided. Builder may at its discretion hold Subcontractor accountable for value of materials damaged by negligent Subcontractor care.
                Builder may back charge the Subcontractor for the cost of materials, deemed by Builder to be damaged by negligent Subcontractor care. Subcontractor promptly shall notify Builder of any defects in any materials supplied by Builder.
              </p>
<h4>11. PAYMENT</h4>
<p>
                Builder shall provide stated time frames for Subcontractor to submit invoices for the work performed. Invoices not received by the stated time will be processed and paid in the next pay period.
                Invoices in question will be held in their entirety until the disputed charge is resolved. Payment for a disputed charge may be held from the Subcontractor’s total payment regardless of the specific project in dispute.
              </p>
<h4>12. INSURANCE</h4>

                Subcontractor shall provide Builder at the time of the signing of this agreement with a Certificate of Insurance, showing the following insurance during the period of the contract and to provide evidence of such insurance when requested.
